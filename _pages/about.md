I am a second-year PhD student in Computational Linguistics at the [University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). I recently finished a Masters at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Alan Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) and [Yulia Tsvetkov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/). Before any graduate studies, I spent 1 year at SRI International, working in their Speech Technology and Research Lab. Prior to that, I graduated from Wellesley College in 2016, where I studied Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences with a concentration in Computer Science.

Generally, I am interested in multilingual NLP and speech processing, low-resource language technology, non-native speech usage, code-switching, and linguistic typology. My recent research involves investigating accommodation in code-switched dialogues, and I am supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I encourage students to contact me with questions about Computational Linguistics, NLP, graduate school, applications, etc---just email me!

When I'm not working, I like to cook, dance, take photos of handmade [felted animals](https://www.instagram.com/lintbuddies/), and read the latest novels by my talented friend, [Valentino Mori](https://valentinomori.weebly.com/). Once upon a time, I did taekwondo and rowing for sport.
