# 1: Translate Main Instructions 

<p>
    You and another user online have exactly one mutual friend in common. You know some attributes for each of your friends (like name, school, etc.). Your goal is to find the mutual friend using those attributes!
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li style="color:#FF0000">Please use <b> natural sentences </b> as much as possible.
        <ul>
            <li style="color:#009933"> <b>Do:</b> three of my friends work at the bank </li>
            <li style="color:#FF0000"> <b>Don't do:</b> 3 bank</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
    <li style="color:#FF0000">Avoid simply listing out any attributes (name, company, etc.) of your friends .</li>
    <li> Look at your <b>list of friends</b> at right. </li>
    <li> Use the <b>chat box below</b> to find out more about your partner's friends. </li>
    <li> Once you've found out who it is, select them by clicking <b>Select</b> in the first column.</li>
    <li> <b>If you run out of time while doing the chat, we will still award you money for the HIT</b> if you made a good effort to complete the task.</li>
    <li style="color:#FF0000"><b>Please select carefully</b>. If you select a friend once, the website will not allow you to select another friend for 10 seconds.</li>
    <!--<li style="color:#FF0000"><b>If you experience trouble with your partner</b> and would like to quit (and receive credit for this HIT), a link will appear at the <b>top right</b> of the screen after 2.5 minutes. <b>Note: If you quit the chat you will only receive credit for this HIT if you made a good attempt to finish the chat.</b> </li>-->

<h4>Make sure you have read the instructions carefully, as the task is timed and the clock will start immediately once you are paired. </h4>

"Please wait while we try to find someone to pair you up with.."

'You ran out of time!'

"Your partner's connection has timed out! Waiting for a new chat..."

"Your connection has timed out!"

'You skipped the chat. '

'Your partner has left the chat!'

"Sorry, no other users appear to be active at the moment. Please come back later!"

"Great, you've completed the chat!"

"Please note that you will only get credit for this HIT if you made a good attempt to complete the chat."
